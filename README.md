Alpha Tic-Tac-Toe
Overview
Alpha Tic-Tac-Toe is an exciting project focused on demonstrating an AI agent capable of mastering the classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game using principles inspired by DeepMind's AlphaZero algorithm. This project aims to provide a clear and functional example of self-play reinforcement learning, complete with a game environment, AI training pipeline, and a user-friendly interface.

Features
Self-Play Training: The AI learns optimal strategies through self-play, starting with no prior game knowledge.
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): Implements MCTS for intelligent move selection and robust exploration of game states.
Neural Network (ResNet): Utilizes a Residual Neural Network with both policy and value heads to evaluate positions and predict move probabilities.
Interactive Play: Play against the trained AI via a simple command-line interface or a web-based UI.
Scalable Deployment: Models are containerized using Docker for easy deployment and integration.
